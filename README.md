ChessUI - Chess Symphony
------------------------
------------------------
Thank you for checking out my Chess UI!

ChessUI or Chess Symphony is a GUI for playing chess either between two human players or against an AI. It does not come with a chess engine. It is, however compatible with any UCI based engine (for example Stockfish). The application is written in English and localised for Slovene. Basic functionalities include highlighting possible squares, notifying when the king is under attack. It also supports all special moves in chess (En passant, Castling, etc.).

Playing board is fully customizable as textures for squares and units are loaded at runtime. Pieces are named in the following manner: first letter represents color (b or w), followed by the first (pronounced) letter of the figure (b-bishop, k-king, n-knight, p-pawn, q-queen, r-rook). Squares are similarly named bsq and wsq.

To load a Chess Engine go to Options -> Settings and locate the endine's executable. You can also set AI difficulty by setting search depth from 1 to 20. Higher depth can mean much slower AI turns. In the second tab of Settings you can also change square color/texture, change font of chessboard markings or load a different set of pieces. All settings are persistent.

In the right window moves are registered and on the bottom you can see detailed decision logic made by AI when playing against it.
